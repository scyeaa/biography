    <p class="p1"> Hello! My name is Josiah Hale Ferrater, 14 years old, and a student from RTPM-DSHS. The name came from Josiah  from the King of Judah and Hale came from the band in the Early 2000's. I like to read, play guitar and do what else is there for entertainment. I live in Sibulan, Dumaguete with my cousin with most of my family in Santa Catalina. Thank you for reading!
